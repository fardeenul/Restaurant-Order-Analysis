In this project, we play the role of an Analytics Consultant for a local restaurant üçù. We utilize flat files containing information about the restaurant's menu items and orders over the past three months. The goal is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) that helps us:  

- Understand order seasonality  
- Evaluate menu item performance  
- Provide insights and recommendations for optimizing operations
